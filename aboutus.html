         <p>Every year our girls participate in 2 competitions (we are in the process of choosing which 2 competitions to attend this year). While we do compete, our main events are cheering at football games.</p>

			<p>Our purpose is to give young girls between ages 5-14 an opportunity to learn cheer skils and form bonds with other girls their age and work as a team to perform excellent
			cheer and dance routines. All of our cheer coaches are volunteers and this is their way of giving back to their community!</p>

			<p>If you did not know, being a cheerleader is expensive! The price for new girls is roughly $600. Now don't fret because we don't collect it all at once. We have monthly payments of about $120, you can pay less or more if you'd like. We also offer scholarships to select families that suffer from financial struggles.</p>
